# CovidTimeSeries
A simple java class for plotting data from pcm-dpc (aka protezione civile) data of the virus covid-19 in Italy

It can generate TimeSeries plot, one with all the data in one plot and the other with only one feature in one plot

From 29-03-2020 the pcm-dpc changed the datasets, so because the curves is lowering from the 21st of March and the dataset changes reqire more effort, I will not update anymore this repo.
